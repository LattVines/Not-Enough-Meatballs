# Not-Enough-Meatballs
A small shooter game project made for Ludum Dare 37 using Unity 5.

the theme was *One Room*. I had had an idea a while back for a game before the jam involving being stuck inside a room and the game keeps flashing NOT ENOUGH MEAT BALLS. But that idea on its own has some limitations. So I combined it with a box map, my favorite kind from old shooter games.

you can play it in the browser or download Win64 build here: `https://tartlegames.itch.io/not-enough-meatballs`
