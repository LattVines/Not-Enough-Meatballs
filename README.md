# Not-Enough-Meatballs
A small shooter game project made for Ludum Dare 37 using Unity 5.

the theme was *One Room*. I had had an idea a while back for a game before the jam involving being stuck inside a room and the game keeps flashing NOT ENOUGH MEAT BALLS. But that idea on its own has some limitations. So I combined it with a box map, my favorite kind from old shooter games.

you can play it in the browser or download Win64 build here: `https://tartlegames.itch.io/not-enough-meatballs`

License note:

feel free to modify and build off of this project. I am going to try and do so myself soon. I do ask, however, that if you do make a game based on this to let me know. I'd love to play it. Also I ask that you do not directly reuse the art that is included in the project without asking first. I am not going to come after you with a meatball cannon if you do, but you will make me very sad.
